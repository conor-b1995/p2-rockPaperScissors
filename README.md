# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a a twist on the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors which originated on the show The Big Bang Theory. The purpose of the game is to entertain both new and returning users by allowing them to compete against the computer, where the first to win 10 rounds wins the overall game. For a first time user there is a rule section which clearly indicates all winning scenarios for each selection. The figure needed for the user or computer is displayed clearly in a paragraph below the rules. The game also validates the user inputs (rock, paper, scissors, lizard or spock) and gives feedback to the user where needed. Feedback is provided for each round with text and the score board is updated after each round increasing the score of the user score or the computer score depending on who wins the round. Feedback is also provided at the end of the game by an end of game modal which pops up announcing the winner and gives the user the chance to play again.
